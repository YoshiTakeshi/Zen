### Mint physical coins : How to make minting possible for anyone?
To solve the mint problem, we will use **3D Metal Printer**.

Today, with the use of traditional 3D Printers. Any one can print at home any 3D model in any affordable materials like plastic, polycarbonate, polyamide, etc.

Tomorrow, with the evolution of such technology. Any one can print at home with precious metals like copper, silver and gold. today, the 3D Metal Printers have started show, (example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTfCJo3FYI0) but are still expensive and cost $120,000. But surely tommorow it will be more affordable to average people, and any one can print in metal, specially in precious metal.

When the 3D Metal Printer will be affordable. Any one can start minting metal coins. Therefore solving the Mint problem.
